# Automating Amazon Guardduty With IaC

This is an initial repo to bootstrap the tutorial "How to use IaC to Create an Automated AWS Security Solution?"

The `gd-iac-initial.yml` file is for creating the initial Cloud9 instance where all Terraform configuration is performed.  The remaining code samples are used to create two EC2 instances in a VPC that are used for testing and validation in the tutorial.
